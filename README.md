# telegram_pekofy_bot
This Bot is able to pekofy the last message that was sent into a chat
(which is a huge problem since it is agnostic to which chat, which is a huge privacy issue)
HONESTLY, DONT USE THIS BOT WITHOUT FIXING THAT

in order to work it needs https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot

you can install it by using the following command: pip3 install python-telegram-bot --upgrade

further information can be found in the linked Repo

Also notice that this is still a work in progress. There are some things in the code that are not currently used but will be in a future version
